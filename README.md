# Slider-and-Tralslation-functions.

This code combines the power between the sliders _(From MatPlotLib)_ and the Traslation functions. 

This program helps us to realize the importance of simulations. 

## Program

First at all, we need to call all the libraries:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.widgets import Slider, Button
``` 

This last is the most important because this is the one that gives us the Slider options. 

Then I will define the initial functions that can do the next: 

**Squa_C**: This is just for draw a big square with dimentions of 8 each side. 

**Squa**: This is the main function. We start giving the shape of the swuare _(3 x 3)_, then I write functions to transform the radiants to grades using $`a = argument * pi / 180`$




I will plot a square using 5 simple points. 

Then, the program
